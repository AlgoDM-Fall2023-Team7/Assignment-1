## Assignment 1 - Task 3

### Streamlit Application

#### Streamlit-Snowflake Integration

- Develop a Streamlit application that connects to Snowflake using SQLAlchemy.
- The application should allow users to change query substitution parameters from the Streamlit frontend.

## Usage
#### Requirements to Run the App
Before running the Streamlit application, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Your Favorite IDE or Text Editor: Use an integrated development environment (IDE) or a text editor of your choice for code editing.

- Python 3.8 - Python 3.11: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system, preferably in the version range from Python 3.8 to Python 3.11.

- Snowflake Account: You need access to a Snowflake account to connect to the Snowflake database.

- PIP: Ensure that PIP, the Python package manager, is installed on your system.

Create a new Python virtual environment and activate it.

Install Streamlit and other required packages.

Before running the Streamlit application, add your Snowflake credentials to a .env file in the project directory. Include the following information:
##### .env file
- SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT = your_account_url
- SNOWFLAKE_USER = your_username
- SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD = your_password
- SNOWFLAKE_ROLE = your_role
- SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE = your_warehouse
- SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE = your_database
- SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA = your_schema

Once you have set up your environment and configured Snowflake credentials, you can run the Streamlit application using the following command:
streamlit run main.py
